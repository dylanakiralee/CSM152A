WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   Mram_current_state[3]_GND_9_o_Mux_84_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      7
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         7
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   224 out of     600   37%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       128 out of   1,200   10%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          677
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           619 out of     677   91%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              31 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
